## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Firebase Storage Structure
```
firebase-storage/
├── users/
│   ├── {userId}_profile_{timestamp}.jpg
│   └── {userId}_profile_{timestamp}.jpg
└── businesses/
    ├── {businessId}_profile_{timestamp}.jpg
    ├── {businessId}_gallery_{timestamp}.jpg
    └── {businessId}_gallery_{timestamp}.jpg
```

### Firestore Document Updates
- **User profiles**: Updates `profilePhoto` field
- **Business profiles**: Updates `profilePhoto` field  
- **Business galleries**: Adds to `photos` array using `arrayUnion`

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

### Security Features

- ✅ **File Type Validation**: Only allows image files
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Requires authenticated users
- ✅ **Business Ownership**: Only business owners can upload to their business

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **Image Compression**: Uses 0.8 quality for optimal file size
- ✅ **Atomic Operations**: Uses Firebase increment for safe concurrent updates
- ✅ **Error Resilience**: Upload failures don't break user experience
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress indication

   - Tap "Add Media" button
   - Select and upload photos
   - Verify photos appear in gallery and can be managed

### Error Testing
- Test with no permissions granted
- Test with poor network connectivity
- Test with large file sizes
- Test with invalid file types

## 📱 User Experience

### Upload Flow
1. User taps upload area
2. System requests permissions (if needed)
3. User selects camera or gallery
4. User takes/selects photo
5. Photo uploads with progress indication
