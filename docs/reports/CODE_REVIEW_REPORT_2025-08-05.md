# Code Review Report: August 5, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

The project is currently in a **critical and non-functional state**. A combination of conflicting authentication implementations, broken file references, and stale code has rendered the application unable to build or run. The immediate priority is to stabilize the application by resolving a critical import error. Following that, a significant effort is required to consolidate the authentication logic to use Firebase exclusively, as per the user's direction, and remove obsolete and confusing code.

## 2. Overall Health Assessment

- **Build Status:** ðŸ”´ **Broken**
- **Architecture Cohesion:** ðŸ”´ **Poor**
- **Code Quality:** ðŸŸ¡ **Inconsistent**
- **Readiness:** ðŸ”´ **Not Deployable**

The project structure is well-organized by domain (admin, user, business), which is a positive aspect. However, the implementation within these domains is inconsistent, particularly concerning data services and authentication.

## 3. Key Issues and Risks

### 3.1. Critical Build Failure: Broken Import
- **Issue:** The main `App.tsx` file attempts to import `SimpleLoginScreen` which has been deleted, causing the Metro bundler to fail and the app to crash on startup.
- **Risk:** This is a blocking issue that prevents any part of the application from being tested or run.
- **Files Affected:** `App.tsx`

### 3.2. Conflicting Authentication Implementations
- **Issue:** The codebase contains at least three different authentication services:
    1.  `services/firebase.ts` with `services/authService.ts` (The user-preferred Firebase implementation).
    2.  `services/mockAuthService.ts` (A mock service with hardcoded users).
    3.  `services/sqliteAuthService.ts` (Referenced in `hooks/useAuth.ts`, indicating a third, local database approach).
- **Risk:** This is the primary source of architectural confusion. It's unclear which service is authoritative. Hooks like `useAuth.ts` and `useFirebaseAuth.ts` point to different underlying services, leading to unpredictable behavior and making debugging extremely difficult.
- **Files Affected:** `hooks/useAuth.ts`, `hooks/useFirebaseAuth.ts`, `services/authService.ts`, `services/mockAuthService.ts`, `services/sqliteAuthService.ts`.

### 3.3. Inconsistent UI and Data
- **Issue:** The `LoginScreen.tsx` component contains hardcoded "quick login" buttons with credentials (e.g., 'slackerchris', 'manager@example.com') that do not exist in the `mockAuthService.ts` and likely do not exist in the Firebase backend.
- **Risk:** This creates a confusing and broken user experience. Even if the app were running, these login buttons would fail. It indicates a disconnect between the UI and the data layer.
- **Files Affected:** `components/auth/LoginScreen.tsx`

### 3.4. Stale and Orphaned Code
- **Issue:** The presence of backup files (`.backup`), an empty `src/App.tsx`, and multiple unused service files creates clutter and increases the cognitive load for developers.
- **Risk:** Stale code can be accidentally imported or referenced, leading to bugs. It also makes the project harder to navigate and maintain.

## 4. Recommended Action Plan

The following steps are proposed to stabilize the project and align it with the intended architecture.

### **Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization**

1.  **Fix Build Error:**
    *   **Action:** Edit `App.tsx` to remove the import statement for the deleted `SimpleLoginScreen`.
    *   **Goal:** Get the application to a state where it can be successfully bundled by Metro.

### **Phase 2: Architectural Consolidation**

2.  **Standardize on Firebase Authentication:**
    *   **Action:** Modify `hooks/useAuth.ts` to use the official Firebase `authService` instead of `sqliteAuthService`. Better yet, perform a workspace-wide replacement of `useAuth` with `useFirebaseAuth` and delete `hooks/useAuth.ts`.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure that all components uniformly use `useFirebaseAuth` for all authentication-related logic.

3.  **Remove Obsolete Services:**
    *   **Action:** Delete `services/mockAuthService.ts` and `services/sqliteAuthService.ts`.
    *   **Goal:** Eliminate confusion and enforce a single, clear data-access pattern for authentication.

### **Phase 3: UI and Logic Cleanup**

4.  **Clean Up Login Screen:**
    *   **Action:** Remove the hardcoded "Quick Login" buttons from `LoginScreen.tsx`.
    *   **Goal:** Provide a clean, functional login screen that works exclusively with the Firebase backend. This removes a source of user confusion and failed login attempts.

5.  **Verify and Test:**
    *   **Action:** Restart the Expo development server with a clean cache (`npx expo start --clear`).
    *   **Goal:** Confirm that the application loads, the login screen appears, and that user registration and login function correctly against the Firebase backend.
