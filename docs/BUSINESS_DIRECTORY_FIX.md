# Business Directory Navigation Fix Implementation

## Problem Description

There was an error when users tried to click on a business in the directory to view its details. The issue occurred because:

1. The `OptimizedBusinessListScreen` component was passing the business object as a parameter when navigating to the business details screen:
   ```javascript
   navigation.navigate('BusinessDetails', { business: item })
   ```

2. But the `BusinessDetailsScreen` component expected a `businessId` parameter:
   ```javascript
   const { businessId } = route.params;
   ```

This parameter mismatch caused errors when users tried to navigate from the business directory to business details screens.

## Solution Implemented

1. Created a new version of the business list screen (`BusinessListScreenFix.tsx`) that:
   - Properly extracts the business ID from either `business.businessId` or `business.id`
   - Passes only the businessId parameter when navigating:
     ```javascript
     navigation.navigate('BusinessDetails', { businessId })
     ```

2. Created a new version of the business details screen (`BusinessDetailsScreenFix.tsx`) that:
   - Properly handles the `businessId` parameter
   - Uses the `useBusinessDetails` hook to fetch the business data by ID
   - Implements proper loading and error states
   - Fixes TypeScript type issues with a more comprehensive business interface definition
   - Adds debug logging to help diagnose any future issues

3. Added defensive code in the business details screen:
   - Shows a loading state while fetching business data
   - Displays a proper error message if business data can't be loaded
   - Adds proper type checking for optional properties

## Implementation Details

### Navigation Flow Changes

The fix changes the navigation parameter passing from:
```javascript
// Before
navigation.navigate('BusinessDetails', { business: item })
```

To:
```javascript
// After
navigation.navigate('BusinessDetails', { businessId: item.businessId || item.id })
```

### Business Details Screen Changes

The business details screen now fetches the business data using the businessId parameter:
```javascript
const { businessId } = route.params;
const { business, loading, error } = useBusinessDetails(businessId);
```

### Type Definitions

Added a more comprehensive `BusinessDetails` interface that includes all possible properties that might be in the business data:
- Basic business information (name, description, etc.)
- Contact details
- Location information
- Accessibility features
- Reviews
- Hours of operation

### Error Handling

Added proper error handling with user-friendly error messages:
- Loading state while fetching data
- Error state if the business can't be found
- "Back to Directory" button to return to the business list

## Deployment Instructions

1. Replace the current `OptimizedBusinessListScreen.tsx` with the new `BusinessListScreenFix.tsx`
2. Replace the current `BusinessDetailsScreen.tsx` with the new `BusinessDetailsScreenFix.tsx`
3. Test the business directory navigation to ensure it works for all user types
