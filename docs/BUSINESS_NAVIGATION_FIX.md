# Business Details Navigation Fix

## Issue
When clicking on a business in the directory, users were encountering an error:
```
ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'category' of undefined
```

This was happening because there was a parameter mismatch between the `OptimizedBusinessListScreen` and `BusinessDetailsScreen` components:

- `OptimizedBusinessListScreen` was passing a `businessId` parameter
- But `BusinessDetailsScreen` was expecting a complete `business` object

## Solution Implemented

1. Updated `BusinessDetailsScreen.tsx` to:
   - Accept a `businessId` parameter instead of a `business` object
   - Use the `useBusinessDetails` hook to fetch business data by ID
   - Add loading and error states for better user experience
   - Add debug logging to help diagnose any issues

2. No changes were needed to `OptimizedBusinessListScreen.tsx` as it was already passing the correct parameter.

## Technical Implementation

### Parameter Changes
Changed from:
```tsx
interface BusinessDetailsScreenProps {
  route: { params: { business: BusinessListing; }; };
}
```

To:
```tsx
interface BusinessDetailsScreenProps {
  route: { params: { businessId: string; }; };
}
```

### Data Fetching
Added data fetching using the useBusinessDetails hook:
```tsx
const { businessId } = route.params;
const { business, loading, error } = useBusinessDetails(businessId);
```

### UI Improvements
Added loading and error states to improve user experience:
- Loading state with a loading message
- Error state with a clear error message and back button

### Debug Logging
Added console logs to help diagnose issues:
```tsx
console.log('BusinessDetailsScreen - businessId:', businessId);
console.log('BusinessDetailsScreen - loading:', loading);
console.log('BusinessDetailsScreen - error:', error);
console.log('BusinessDetailsScreen - business:', business);
```

## Expected Results
- Users can now click on businesses in the directory without encountering errors
- If there's a problem loading a business, users will see a helpful error message
- The console logs will help identify any ongoing issues with specific businesses
