## Issue Description
**Priority**: ðŸ”¥ HIGH  
**Labels**: `ðŸ”¥ high-priority`, `â™¿ accessibility`, `ðŸŽ¨ ui/ux`

The application needs comprehensive accessibility improvements to meet WCAG 2.2 AA compliance standards and ensure inclusive user experience for all users.

## Current Accessibility Issues
- Missing accessibilityLabel on interactive elements
- No keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast ratios not audited
- No screen reader optimization
- Motion preferences not respected

## WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance Target
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Color contrast ratio â‰¥ 4.5:1
- [ ] Motion preference respect
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] Alternative navigation methods

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Add proper `accessibilityLabel` to all interactive elements
- [ ] Implement `accessibilityHint` for complex interactions
- [ ] Add `accessibilityRole` for custom components
- [ ] Implement `accessibilityState` for dynamic elements

### 2. Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are focusable
- [ ] Implement proper tab order throughout app
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Test with external keyboard on mobile devices

### 3. Color & Contrast Audit
- [ ] Audit all color combinations for contrast ratios
- [ ] Implement high contrast mode support
- [ ] Ensure information isn't conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Add visual indicators beyond color

### 4. Motion & Animation
- [ ] Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting
- [ ] Add alternative navigation for gesture-based interactions
- [ ] Implement focus management for screen transitions
- [ ] Provide motion controls in settings
