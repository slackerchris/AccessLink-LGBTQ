# âš¡ Performance Optimization - React Components & Bundle Size

## Issue Description
**Priority**: ðŸ”¥ HIGH  
**Labels**: `ðŸ”¥ high-priority`, `âš¡ performance`, `ðŸŽ¨ ui/ux`

The application needs performance optimizations to ensure smooth user experience, especially for list rendering and bundle size management.

## Current Performance Issues
- No memoization on heavy components
- Business list rendering not optimized
- Large bundle size (~15MB estimated)
- No lazy loading for non-critical components

## Performance Targets
- [ ] Bundle size < 10MB (currently ~15MB estimated)
- [ ] First render < 2 seconds
- [ ] List scroll performance 60fps
- [ ] Memory usage < 100MB baseline

## Implementation Plan

### 1. React Performance Optimization
```typescript
// Example: Memoize heavy components
const BusinessListItem = React.memo(({ business, onSave, onUnsave }) => {
  const isBusinessSaved = useMemo(() => 
    savedBusinesses.includes(business.id), [savedBusinesses, business.id]
  );
  
  return <View>...</View>;
});
```

### 2. List Virtualization
- [ ] Replace ScrollView with FlatList for business listings
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh optimization
- [ ] Add infinite scroll with proper loading states
- [ ] Optimize list item rendering with getItemLayout

### 3. Bundle Size Optimization
- [ ] Analyze bundle with `npx react-native-bundle-visualizer`
- [ ] Implement code splitting for admin screens
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies and optimize imports

### 4. Image Optimization
- [ ] Implement image caching system
- [ ] Add image compression for uploads
- [ ] Use appropriate image formats (WebP where supported)
- [ ] Implement progressive image loading

## Tasks

### Component Memoization
- [ ] Add React.memo to `BusinessListItem` components
- [ ] Memoize expensive computations with useMemo
- [ ] Optimize useCallback usage in event handlers
- [ ] Implement shouldComponentUpdate equivalent optimizations

### List Performance
- [ ] Convert business list to FlatList with proper keyExtractor
- [ ] Implement getItemLayout for consistent item sizing
- [ ] Add pull-to-refresh functionality
- [ ] Implement infinite scroll pagination

### Bundle Analysis & Optimization
- [ ] Run bundle analyzer and document findings
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for admin components
- [ ] Split vendor and app bundles
- [ ] Optimize third-party library usage

### Image & Asset Optimization
- [ ] Set up image caching with react-native-fast-image
- [ ] Implement image compression for user uploads
- [ ] Optimize existing image assets
- [ ] Add placeholder loading states

## Files to Modify
- `components/business/BusinessListScreen.tsx`
- `components/business/BusinessListItem.tsx` (create if needed)
- `components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Multiple component files for memoization
- `App.tsx` (lazy loading setup)

## Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring in development
- [ ] Add React DevTools Profiler integration
- [ ] Implement performance logging for critical paths
- [ ] Create performance regression testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Bundle size reduced below 10MB
- [ ] List scrolling maintains 60fps
- [ ] First render time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Bundle analysis documented
- [ ] Performance regression tests added

## Estimated Time
**4-5 days**

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Performance testing on various devices
- [ ] Memory leak testing
- [ ] Bundle size regression testing
- [ ] List performance stress testing
