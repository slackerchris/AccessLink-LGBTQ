# 🧪 Complete Testing Implementation - Component & Integration Tests

## Issue Description
**Priority**: 🔥 HIGH  
**Labels**: `🔥 high-priority`, `🧪 testing`, `🏗️ infrastructure`

Complete the testing infrastructure by fixing component tests and implementing integration tests to reach 80% overall coverage target.

## Current Testing Status ✅
- **Overall Coverage**: 11.28% (target: 80%)
- **Service Coverage**: 34.57% (good foundation)
- **AuthService Coverage**: 86.76% (excellent)
- **Total Tests**: 108 tests (75 passing, 33 component tests need fixes)

## Testing Framework Status
- Jest + React Native Testing Library ✅ 
- Firebase emulator integration ✅
- Coverage reporting ✅
- Service tests complete ✅

## Remaining Work

### 1. Fix Component Tests (PRIORITY)
Current component tests are failing due to React Native Testing Library setup issues:

```typescript
// Component tests need refinement
⚠️ Login/signup forms (React Native Testing Library setup needs refinement)
⚠️ Business list rendering
⚠️ Admin dashboard functionality
```

### 2. Hook Testing Implementation
- [ ] `useAuth.ts` - Authentication state management
- [ ] `useBusiness.ts` - Business data operations
- [ ] Custom hook testing patterns

### 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] Authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Business listing creation/edit flow  
- [ ] Admin approval workflow
- [ ] Firebase integration tests (ready but not running)

### 4. End-to-End Critical Paths
- [ ] Complete user registration and login
- [ ] Business search and save functionality
- [ ] Admin user management workflow
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Tasks

### Component Test Fixes
- [ ] Fix `SimpleLoginScreen.test.tsx` rendering issues
- [ ] Implement `SignUpScreen.test.tsx` form testing
- [ ] Create `BusinessListScreen.test.tsx` with proper mocking

- [ ] Fix React Native Testing Library configuration issues

### Hook Testing Implementation  
- [ ] Create `__tests__/hooks/useAuth.test.ts`
- [ ] Create `__tests__/hooks/useBusiness.test.ts`

- [ ] Enable Firebase integration tests in CI

### Coverage Improvement
- [ ] Identify uncovered code paths
- [ ] Add missing edge case tests
- [ ] Implement error scenario testing
- [ ] Add performance/load testing
