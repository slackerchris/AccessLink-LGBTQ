# Admin Management Guide

## How to Make Users Admin

### Method 1: Using the CLI Tool (Recommended for first admin)

1. **First, make sure the user has registered in your app**
   - The user must have created an account through the app first
   - Check Firebase Console > Authentication to verify the user exists

2. **Run the CLI tool from your project directory:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/make-admin.js user@example.com
   ```

3. **Example:**
   ```bash
   # Make yourself admin (replace with your email)
   node scripts/make-admin.js chris@example.com
   
   # Make another user admin
   node scripts/make-admin.js admin@yourcompany.com
   ```

### Method 2: Using the App Interface (Once you have an admin)

1. **Log in as an admin user**
2. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard** (should appear in user menu)
3. **Go to User Management**
4. **Click "üëë Make Admin" button** in the header
5. **Enter the user's email address**

## Troubleshooting

### "User not found" error:
- Make sure the user has registered in the app first
- Check spelling of the email address
- Verify the user exists in Firebase Console > Authentication

### "Permission denied" error:
- Make sure you're running as an admin user
- Check your Firebase security rules
- Verify the user document exists in Firestore

### Admin UI not showing:
- Log out and log back in
- Check that the user's role is set to 'admin' in Firestore
- Verify the usePermissions hook is working correctly

### "Something seems hung in the admin debug screen":
- Run the database initialization script: `node scripts/init-database.js`
- Check the console for error messages
- Try refreshing the admin debug dashboard
- Create sample data to test: `node scripts/create-sample-businesses.js`

### Business count showing 0 or hanging:
- Initialize database collections: `node scripts/init-database.js`
- Create sample businesses: `node scripts/create-sample-businesses.js`
- Create business owners/managers: `node scripts/create-business-users.js`
- Check Firebase console to verify the 'businesses' collection exists
- Use the debug dashboard's "Create Sample Data" button

### Testing multi-business ownership:
- Use account: `alex.rainbow@example.com` (owns Rainbow Caf√© and Spectrum Fitness)
- Use account: `jamie.manager@rainbowcafe.com` (manages Rainbow Caf√© for Alex)
- Use account: `sam.trainer@spectrumfitness.com` (manages Spectrum Fitness for Alex)
- Use account: `dr.maria.santos@inclusivehealth.com` (owns Inclusive Health Clinic)
