## How to Make Users Admin

### Method 1: Using the CLI Tool (Recommended for first admin)

1. **First, make sure the user has registered in your app**
   - The user must have created an account through the app first
   - Check Firebase Console > Authentication to verify the user exists

2. **Run the CLI tool from your project directory:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/make-admin.js user@example.com
   ```

3. **Example:**
   ```bash
   # Make yourself admin (replace with your email)
   node scripts/make-admin.js chris@example.com
   
   # Make another user admin
   node scripts/make-admin.js admin@yourcompany.com
   ```

### Method 2: Using the App Interface (Once you have an admin)

1. **Log in as an admin user**
2. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard** (should appear in user menu)
3. **Go to User Management**
4. **Click "üëë Make Admin" button** in the header
5. **Enter the user's email address**

## Troubleshooting

### "User not found" error:
- Make sure the user has registered in the app first
- Check spelling of the email address
- Verify the user exists in Firebase Console > Authentication

### "Permission denied" error:
- Make sure you're running as an admin user
- Check your Firebase security rules
- Verify the user document exists in Firestore

### Admin UI not showing:
- Log out and log back in
- Check that the user's role is set to 'admin' in Firestore
- Verify the usePermissions hook is working correctly

## Firebase Database Structure

Admin users have this structure in Firestore:
```json
{
  "uid": "user-id",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "admin",  // ‚Üê This is the key field
  "displayName": "User Name",
  "isEmailVerified": true,
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

The role field can be:
- `"user"` - Regular user
- `"business_owner"` - Business account
- `"admin"` - Full administrator
