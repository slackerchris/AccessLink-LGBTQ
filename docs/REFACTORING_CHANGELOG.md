# Refactoring and Optimization Changelog

This document tracks the major refactoring and optimization work performed on the AccessLink LGBTQ+ codebase.

## Summary

The primary goal of this refactoring effort is to improve code quality, maintainability, performance, and to establish a consistent and scalable architectural pattern across the application.

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Theme-Aware Styling (`useTheme` Hook)

-   **File:** `hooks/useTheme.ts`
-   **Change:** The `useTheme` hook was fixed to correctly implement and provide a `createStyles` helper function.
-   **Impact:** This is a cornerstone of the new architecture. It allows components to define their styles in a way that automatically adapts to the application's theme (e.g., light mode, dark mode) without manual prop drilling. All refactored components now use `const styles = createStyles(localStyles);` instead of the static `StyleSheet.create`.

### 2. Component Decomposition and Memoization

-   **Pattern:** Large, monolithic components are being systematically decomposed into smaller, single-responsibility functional components.
-   **Optimization:** These smaller sub-components are wrapped in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, leading to significant performance improvements in the UI.
-   **Impact:** This improves code readability, makes components easier to test and maintain, and enhances overall application performance.

## Refactored Components

The following components have been successfully migrated to the new architecture.

### `/components/admin/`

-   **`AdminDashboard.tsx`**
    -   Decomposed into memoized sub-components: `DashboardHeader`, `StatCard`, `ActionCard`, `PendingBusinessCard`, `AccessDenied`, and `EmptyState`.
    -   All styling converted to use the theme-aware `createStyles` helper.

-   **`AdminHomeScreen.tsx`**
    -   Decomposed into memoized sub-components: `Header`, `StatsGrid`, `QuickActions`, and `RecentActivity`.
    -   Styling updated to be theme-aware.

-   **`AdminPortalScreen.tsx`**
    -   Decomposed into memoized sub-components: `PortalHeader`, `ThemeToggle`, `PortalSection`, `SignOutButton`, and `VersionInfo`.
    -   Styling updated to be theme-aware.

-   **`BusinessManagementScreen.tsx`**
    -   Decomposed into memoized sub-components: `Header`, `SearchBar`, `FilterTabs`, and `BusinessListItem`.
    -   The `Modal` component was kept within the main component for state management simplicity, but all other UI elements were separated.
    -   Styling updated to be theme-aware.

-   **`DebugDashboard.tsx`**
    -   Decomposed into memoized sub-components: `Header` and `TabBar`.
    -   Fixed a bug related to checking the user's admin status (`userProfile.role` instead of `user.userType`).
    -   Styling updated to be theme-aware.

## Next Steps

The refactoring process is ongoing. The next steps are:

1.  **Complete the `/components/admin/` directory:**
    -   Refactor `UserManagementScreen.tsx`.
    -   Address the empty `SimpleDebugDashboard.tsx` file.
2.  **Continue Systematic Refactoring:**
    -   Apply the same architectural improvements to the remaining component directories:
        -   `/components/auth/`
        -   `/components/business/`
        -   `/components/common/`
        -   `/components/user/`
