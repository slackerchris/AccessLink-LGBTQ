# Saved Places Feature Implementation

## Overview
The saved places feature allows users to bookmark businesses they want to remember or revisit. This feature stores bookmarks in the user's Firestore profile and provides a seamless save/unsave experience across the app.

## Database Schema

### Storage Location
Saved places are stored in the user's profile document in Firestore:

```typescript
// Firestore: collection('users').doc(userId)
{
  profile: {
    details: {
      savedBusinesses: ["business_id_1", "business_id_2", "business_id_3"]
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript
const isSaved = await savedPlacesService.isBusinessSaved(userId, businessId);
```

## Navigation Flow

1. **User browses businesses** → Directory/Business List
2. **Views business details** → Business Details Screen
3. **Taps bookmark icon** → Business saved/unsaved
4. **Accesses saved places** → Portal → Saved Places
