# APK Build Guide for AccessLink LGBTQ+

Since this development environment doesn't have the required Android SDK tools or EAS project permissions, here are the recommended approaches to compile your APK:

## Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
1. Create an Expo account at expo.dev if you don't have one
2. Either upgrade to a paid plan or create a new project under your account

### Steps
1. **Create a new EAS project:**
   ```bash
   npx eas init
   ```
   
2. **Build APK for testing:**
   ```bash
   npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```
   
   Or for production:
   ```bash
   npx eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```

### EAS Configuration (already created)
The `eas.json` file has been configured with:
- **Development**: Development client for testing
- **Preview**: APK build for internal distribution
- **Production**: AAB (Android App Bundle) for Google Play Store

## Option 2: Local Development Build

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio with Android SDK
- Android device or emulator

### Steps
1. **Install Android Studio and SDK**
2. **Prebuild the project:**
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```
   
3. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

## Option 3: Expo Development Build Service

### Steps
1. **Export the project:**
   ```bash
   npx expo export --platform android
   ```
   
2. **Use a build service like:**
   - GitHub Actions with EAS Build
   - Bitrise
   - CircleCI with Android build environment

## Current Project Status

✅ **Ready for Build:**
- App configuration is complete

npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

**For Production Release:**
```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## App Configuration Summary

- **App Name**: AccessLink LGBTQ+
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Next Steps
