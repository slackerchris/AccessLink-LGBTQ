## 🚀 **My Recommendation**

**Start with Expo Go** (Option 1) because:
- ✅ **Works immediately** - no build time
- ✅ **Hot reload** - changes appear instantly
- ✅ **Perfect for development** - fast iteration
- ✅ **Real device testing** - actual Android hardware
- ✅ **No storage space** - doesn't install permanently

Once you're happy with the app, then build a development APK (Option 2) for:
- Testing without internet connection
- Sharing with others who don't have Expo Go
- More realistic production-like testing

---

## 🔍 **Current Status**

Your AccessLink LGBTQ+ app is:
- ✅ **Running on Expo development server**
- ✅ **QR code ready for instant mobile testing**
- ✅ **All features working** (domain integration, buttons, etc.)
- ✅ **Development build dependencies installed**
- 🔧 **Ready for APK builds** (when you want them)

**Bottom line: You can test your Android app RIGHT NOW with Expo Go!** 📱✨
